<h2> About me: </h2>
<p> I was born and raised in a suburb of Boston MA.  I went to
a small Jewish highschool called Gann Academy, and then graduated and now I go to Tufts 
University.
</p>
<p> At Gann Academy, I was on the Robotics Team from Freshman to Junior year,
and in an acapella group from sophomore to senior year.  Now in Tufts I'm in the
Engineering school and planning to major in computer science and minor in music.
</p>
<p> In my free time I enjoy playing music, being outside, hanging out with
friends, and playing card games or video games.  I love meeting people and being in new
places.  I'm a total nerd and I get really excited about anything techy or nerdy, and I'm
a big fan of ice cream.
